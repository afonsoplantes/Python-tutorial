# Python Tutorial

I'm using this repository to improve my Python skills. After using Anaconda for many years, I'm now looking to create isolated environments for each project to better manage them.



## Launcher Windows
This manual provides examples illustrating the usage of the Windows Python Launcher (py.exe).

A shebang directive (**#!**), located on the first line of a script, specifies the interpreter version that the launcher should invoke for execution.

#! python - invokes the last version of python installed 
#! python3.7 - invokes python 3.7 version
